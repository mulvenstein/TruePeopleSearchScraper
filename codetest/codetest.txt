Hey all,

So for this code test I need you to scrape the website (TruePeopleSearch.com) for the first page of results for five different names asynchronously using Python!

Please use the names:
Joe Smith
John Smith
Amy Smith
Jeff Smith
Matt Smith
Don't search too many names on your own connection without using rotating IPs or you will receive an "Access is Denied" message, and you will have to use a VPN!

Upload the code to a private Github Repo & send me the link once you are finished. Please time yourself so we can get a feel for how long it will take you to complete future tasks. Please be honest, don't over or under report your time!

You will need to use rotating proxies & possibly some other tricks in order to scrape this data!

We will be judging the code test on:
If it's able to complete the task
How well structured the code is
How long it took you to code it
How long it took you to submit the code
Let me know if you have any questions!

Good luck.

-Nick
